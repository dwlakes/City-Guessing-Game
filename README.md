# City-Guessing-Game
A Java game where people are given an image and other hints, then have to try to guess the city. The the user can use two hints which displays the main language of the city along with a region. Users can also select between background music ("Around the World" by Daft Punk) or can have a culturally relevant song to the city play. The app also displays a city flag. The app tracks and displays how many games have been played, number of hints used, number of correct and incorrect guesses, and the percentage of correct answers.
